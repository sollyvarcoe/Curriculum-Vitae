\section{\textbf{Employment}}
\datedjob{Ministry of Defense}{Virtual Software Intern}{July 2020 - September 2020}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Researched and implemented a quantum-resilient, lattice based cryptosystem (NTRU) in C.
\item Produced security reports on potential malware by reverse engineering executables using x86 assembly and IDA Pro.
\item Presented to industrial clients such as AWS and IBM on topics such as machine learning and cyber security.
\end{itemize}
\datedjob{CGI (Formerly SCISYS)}{Software Engineer Intern}{July 2019 - September 2019}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
\item Worked as a full stack develepor on a classified AI and automation framework for the Royal Navy and DSTL.
\item Expanded analytic capabilities by designing, implementing and testing a history module, including data visualisation.
\item Increased stability of the front-end interface by 20\% by rewriting all automation tests using a class based model and Selenium. This enabled rapid prototyping of front-end components, as testing logic was seperated from page structure.
\item Embraced Agile development tools such as Git, Sourcetree and Jira to work efficiently within a team of 6 developers. This included presenting my work at daily standups and contributing future ideas at weekly sprint reviews.
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{Overworld (Open Source Contributions)}{Ongoing}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Social network using ReactJS and Python/DjangoDB, enabling users to share their favourite video game moments.
\item Worked with a team of 18 other devleopers to add new features (such as ratings)  and improve technical documentation.
\end{itemize}
\datedsubsection{University Game Jam}{2019}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em
\item Collaborated with 4 other students to create a espionage game within a 24-hour period using C\# and Unity.
\item Prototyped \& iterated quickly on gameplay ideas, including enemy pathfinding and a lighting-based stealth system.
