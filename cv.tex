\indent\indent\textit{First year result: 71\%}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Gained valuable experience with programming languages from all paradigms, notably C, Java and Haskell. I especially enjoyed functional programming (in Haskell) due to its mathematical approach which resulted in a high grade (82\%).
  \item Developed a formal understanding of essential mathematic concepts, both pure and applied, which are currently being put into context in second year units such as Multivariable Calculus.
  \item The transferable skills and algorithmic thinking gained from this degree has allowed me to quickly pick up new languages and concepts. For example, during the summer I developed a personal music visualiser as an excersise to learn JavaScript \& HTML.
  \item Took part in a pair programming module in Java in which I formed strong communication, management and development skills whilst learning industry standard practices e.g Git/Github (version control) and Maven (dependency management).
  \item Strongly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning after being introduced to it during the pair programming module, in which my team developed an AI player for a game as an extension (resulting in a first-class mark). As a result, I plan to take modules in this field in subsesquent years and have taken relevent maths units (Multivariable Calculs and Probability 2) this year.
